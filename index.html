          Group work in cybersecurity is not just about dividing tasks; it is about collaboration and
          problem-solving. Each member contributes unique strengths, whether it be penetration testing,
          analyzing threats, or designing secure systems. This teamwork mirrors how professionals operate
          in real-world scenarios.

          By sharing knowledge and responsibilities, our group has been able to simulate attacks and test
          defenses more effectively. These hands-on sessions give us practical experience, while also
          strengthening our ability to communicate and cooperate under pressure.

        <h2>Lessons Learned from Cybersecurity Group Work</h2>

        <p>
          One of the biggest lessons from our group work is that cybersecurity requires constant learning.
          Threats evolve quickly, so working as a team helps us stay on top of new concepts, tools, and
          techniques. Discussing and debating ideas gives us a wider perspective than working alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also learned the importance of good communication and planning. Without clear roles and
          timelines, projects can easily get disorganized. By treating our group work like a professional
          team exercise, we are preparing ourselves for real-world cybersecurity challenges.
